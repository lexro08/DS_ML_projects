# Research on the reliability of borrowers.

The bank's credit department is working on the development of the *credit scoring* model, a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to the bank.

As one of the bases, the credit department wants to take into account a number of factors, such as marital status and the number of children the borrower has.

**The purpose of the study** is to test the hypothesis about the influence of the marital status and the number of children of the client on the fact of repayment of the loan on time.

# Results of the research:

According to the results of the study, it can be unequivocally stated that **marital status affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time:**

1) So we found out that unmarried borrowers and those who are in a civil marriage most often do not repay loans on time. The bank's credit department should pay more attention to this group.

2) At the same time, widowers are less likely to delay payment on a loan.

3) Married and divorced citizens are probably more moderate in their spending and repay the loan on time more often than unmarried and married.

**The number of children affects the fact of repayment of the loan on time ** - as a rule, families with 1-2 children most often delay the payment of the loan on time.
In general, borrowers with children more often do not repay the loan on time compared to borrowers without children.
