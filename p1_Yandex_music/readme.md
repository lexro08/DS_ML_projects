## Yandex.Music
The comparison of Moscow and St. Petersburg is surrounded by myths. For example:
- Moscow is a megapolis which is influenced by the rigid rhythm of the working days;
- St. Petersburg is a cultural capital, with its own tastes.

Using Yandex.Music data, we will compare the behaviour of users of the two capitals.

The purpose of the study is to test three hypotheses:
- User activity depends on the day of the week. Moreover, in Moscow and St. Petersburg, this manifests itself in different ways.
- On Monday morning, some genres prevail in Moscow, and others in St. Petersburg. Similarly, on Friday evening, different genres prevail — depending on the city.
- Moscow and St. Petersburg prefer different genres of music. In Moscow, pop music is more often listened to, in St. Petersburg - Russian rap.


## Results of the research.
Three hypotheses were tested, on the basis of which it was established:

1. The day of the week has different effects on user activity in Moscow and St. Petersburg.

The first hypothesis was fully confirmed.

2. Musical preferences do not change much during the week — be it Moscow or St. Petersburg. Small differences are noticeable at the beginning of the week, on Mondays:
- in Moscow, they listen to music of the “world” genre,
- in St. Petersburg — jazz and classics.

Thus, the second hypothesis was only partially confirmed. This result could have turned out to be different if not for the omissions in the data.

3. The tastes of users in Moscow and St. Petersburg have more in common than differences. Contrary to expectations, genre preferences in St. Petersburg resemble those in Moscow.

The third hypothesis was not confirmed. If there are differences in preferences, they are invisible to the majority of users.
