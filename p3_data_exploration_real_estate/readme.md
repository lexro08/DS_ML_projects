# Research of ads for the sale of apartments

We have the data of the Yandex Real Estate service — an archive of ads for the sale of apartments in St. Petersburg and neighboring settlements for several years. We need to learn how to determine the market value of real estate. The task is to set the parameters. This will allow us to build an automated system: it will track anomalies and fraudulent activity.

There are two types of data available for each apartment for sale. The first ones are entered by the user, the second ones are obtained automatically based on cartographic data. For example, the distance to the center, the airport, the nearest park and reservoir.

# Results of the research

1) The largest number of ads for the sale of real estate are placed in St. Petersburg. Least of all in the region in towns/villages and villages.

2) The most expensive real estate is represented in Санкт-Петербург.

3) The center of Санкт-Петербург is an area with a radius of about 7 kilometers.

4) Common factors for Санкт-Петербург and the region that affect the cost of real estate: total area (the larger the area, the higher the price), distance from the center of Санкт-Петербург (the closer to the center, the more expensive).

5) The property on the 1st floor has the lowest price.

6) Since 2014, there has been a trend towards a decrease in the average price of real estate.
